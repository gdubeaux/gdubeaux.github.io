Big news, I am an iPad fan. But replacing your Mac laptop with an iPad might seem like a crazy idea. In my opinion, it is not: please give me five minutes of your precious time and explain why…

I am not Federico Viticci, as I am not saying that my iPad will be my only computer. I might be tempted in the future, but as a research associate, a lot of software that I use daily are Windows or Mac only (not even Linux…). In the meantime, I proudly own an iMac 5K, which is by far my favorite computer (the screen is terrific). The iPad Pro is here for its mobility aspect: that is where an iPad excel compared to a Mac laptop. 

I see this post as the first in a long series that will be named “iPad Laptop”. In this first article, I will explain the main reasons that pushed me toward adopting the iPad as a daily portable computer.

### The battery life is so much better than an MBP 🤩

Yes, this is big, but let me tell you one thing: whenever you charge your iPad to 100%, you won’t have to do it throughout the day. At least, that is definitely true most of the time, but if you are a hardcore FaceBook user, it might be a different story…

Whenever I travel (which is not the case these days 🦠), I love having my iPad around because I won’t have to find a plug. From door to door, my iPad Pro as enough battery in most cases. 

Even if the battery is a genuinely *professional* factor, the next one is even bigger.

### Cellular: internet connection wherever and, whenever you want 🌐

If you own a MacBook (Air, Pro…), you know that you will have to rely on Wi-Fi at one point. You might be able to create a hotspot from your phone but, let’s be honest, that doesn’t sound professional…

With my iPad Pro, I am connected all the time (if AT&T does its job as intended). That is a big thing! Whenever I travel somewhere, I can only bring my iPad if I want to, and I don’t have to overthink about Wi-Fi.

### Most of the apps I use are *really* professional ⌨️

That is one of the biggest complaints that I hear about the iPad as a daily computer. But man, you guys are wrong. Of course, you won’t necessarily find the same apps that you have on your computer. Still, I assure you: you can discover great yet professional apps on the App Store.

The only one that is truly missing is Xcode…

Most of the series will focus on my workflows, so I won’t expand on this today.

### The iPad is so much fun 😎

Did you see that coming? The iPad is so much more fun than a boring laptop. And I tend to be more productive on my iPad too. 

If you want me to expand on that point, I will do it in the future, but I am sure that most of you agree on that point.

What I will just say is the following: the iPad is more than just a laptop. It is the greatest tablet of all time. I can read scientific articles on portrait mode and jump back at my desk and use an external keyboard and trackpad to do some writing in less than a minute. Do you often read on your laptop? Because I don’t. And if I was to do so, it is so much better on an iPad.

### The price 💵

You don’t have to spend $2,000 to get a great iPad. If you have $1,000, you will get a great machine and a Smart Keyboard folio. You could add a Magic Trackpad if you really want to go all in…

To get a decent Mac laptop, don’t spend less than $2,000 if you want to keep it for 4-5 years. I have my iPad Pro for 5 years now (I bought the first iPad Pro generation) and spent $1,000 in total. And it is still truly a great daily laptop.

### What’s next? 👀

Okay, now that I said that my iPad is five years old, I have to tell you that I am tempted to replace it with a new generation iPad with a Magic Keyboard. See for yourself:

But boy, that thing is expensive. And iPadOS really works well on my iPad Pro right now. I will just wait for WWDC this year and see what they will present for iPadOS 14 🤩

I hope that I convinced you that an iPad is not just about consumption anymore. Of course, watching Netflix is terrific on an iPad. But you can also get so creative with such a powerful tool. I will explain how in my next articles. Stay tuned!
