The whole process takes roughly a week. You can find many videos online to make your own sourdough starter. Here is what I did to create Marcel and his little brother Gontran, my two starters 🥰

### Day 1
- 100g whole wheat flour (unbleached of course)
- 150g mineral water (you can use filtered water too)
- Stir well and let grow for 12-24h (while I would strongly recommend refreshing your starter every 12 hours to help it get a nice rhythm, you could let you starter grow for 24 hours with similar results in the end)

### Day 2
- 70g of sourdough starter from previous day
- 50g whole wheat flour
- 50g unbleached wheat flour
- 115g mineral water (the hydration level is lower today: a lot of water helps wild yeast to grow in the first place but too much water could trigger your starter to rot in the long run! Be nice with your starter ✌🏼)

### Day 3
