The whole process takes roughly a week. You can find many videos online to make your own sourdough starter. Here is what I did to create Marcel and his little brother Gontran, my two starters 🥰

### Day 1
- 100g whole wheat flour (unbleached of course),
- 150g mineral water (you can use filtered water too),
- Stir well and let grow for 12-24h (while I would strongly recommend refreshing your starter every 12 hours to help it get a nice rhythm, you could let you starter grow for 24 hours with similar results in the end).

### Day 2
- 70g of sourdough starter from previous day,
- 50g whole wheat flour,
- 50g unbleached wheat flour,
- 115g mineral water (the hydration level is lower today: a lot of water helps wild yeast to grow in the first place but too much water could trigger your starter to rot in the long run! Be nice with your starter ✌🏼).

### Day 3 (same as day 2)
- 70g of sourdough starter from previous day,
- 50g whole wheat flour,
- 50g unbleached wheat flour,
- 115g mineral water.

### Day 4 (let’s lower the hydration level even more)
- 70g of sourdough starter from previous day,
- 50g whole wheat flour,
- 50g unbleached wheat flour,
- 100g mineral water.

### Day 5 (same as day 4)
- 70g of sourdough starter from previous day,
- 50g whole wheat flour,
- 50g unbleached wheat flour,
- 100g mineral water.

### Day 6 (same as day 4 and 5)
- 70g of sourdough starter from previous day,
- 50g whole wheat flour,
- 50g unbleached wheat flour,
- 100g mineral water.

### Day 7 (same as day 4, 5 and 6)
- 70g of sourdough starter from previous day,
- 50g whole wheat flour,
- 50g unbleached wheat flour,
- 100g mineral water.

After such a crazy week, your sourdough starter should rise and fall nicely over 12 hours. One could expect a starter to triple in size during a rise 💪🏼

From now on, you have 3 different options to refresh your starter:
- the best: every day 👌🏼. In that case, adapt the recipe of day 7 if you want to slightly modify your starter (in my case, Marcel is refreshed using only unbleached wheat flour while Gontran is refreshed using only whole wheat flour). One could also lower the quantities: 35g of starter from previous day, 50g of flour and 50g of water should do the trick. 
- the “ok” option: every week 👍🏼. In that case, store your starter in the fridge for a week after a nice rise! Follow the “best” option steps.
- the “meeeh” option: every month 😅. I would not recommend that but it could be a backup option ✌🏼. After a full rise, transfer your starter in your freezer and let it there for a month. After a month, thaw it at room temp for 24h and refresh it as you would do for the “best” option. 

With such a great companion at your side, you will be able to make sourdough recipes in no time! 

Stay tuned: next week, I will publish an incredible sourdough bread recipe 😍
