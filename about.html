    <h5 class="card-title">Hi there and thanks for reading my personal blog!</h5>
    <p class="card-text">My name is Guillaume Dubeaux and I am a postdoctoral fellow at UCSD in sunny SoCal.
    <hr>
    I love many different things (and that's not always a great thing 😅). To keep it short, I love <strong>Science</strong>, <strong>Technology</strong> and <strong>Cooking</strong>.<br/>
    But let’s go straight to the point. I am trying to give some rhythm to my blog in 2020. Let’s organize and plan everything, shall we?</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">🔬 Monday: Let’s start the week with a Journal Club.</h5>
      <p class="card-text">I will select an article that I think relevant for everybody (even non-scientist) to read or at least to be aware of.
      <hr>
      I’ve always been in love with science. But to be honest, I only realized during my master that I wanted to be a full-time researcher. To fulfill this goal, I did my PhD at CNRS in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/yahoo.fr/vertlab">Vert lab</a> working on the molecular mechanisms driving the ubiquitination and endocytosis of the plant metal transporter IRT1. I graduated from Paris-Saclay University in December 2016.
      <br/>
      In September 2017, I joined the University of California in San Diego to do a post-doc in Julian Schroeder’s lab. For this postdoc, I am working on CO<sub>2</sub> signaling in plants.</p>

    This section will be exclusively in 🇫🇷. Better than Duolingo or Rosetta Stone courses, Wednesday will be a good day to pratice your french from now on 😉</p>

<h5 class="card-title">📱 Friday: technology day!</h5>
<p class="card-text">On Fridays, I will give my opinion on something big related to technology.
  <hr>
Technology is probably my main passion. I am always focused on tech. I live for tech, I dream about tech. You got it? I am a tech nerd.<br/>
Because of that, I write about tech, I listen to tech podcasts everyday and of course I read tech news as well.<br/>
As a quick anecdote, technology is probably one of the main reason I wanted to live in California. Tech is mostly created there and I wanted to see that with my own eyes...

<p class="card-text">I used to write “Chroniques” for the famous french tech site <a href="https://www.macg.co">MacGeneration</a>. <br/>
  Nowadays, I plan my week to come or long-term goals during weekends. I use Notion to do so and I will talk a lot about it.
  <hr>
  Every other weekend: video-games! Indeed, we recently created a podcast with my awesome Brazilian friend Paulo 🇧🇷. We'll talk about how we reconcile our super busy lives with video-gaming. We are definitely not pros but are trying our best to find time to play even though we don't have plenty of time to do so.<br/>
Our show is called <a href="https://gamebros.fm>">GameBros</a>. Stay tuned!</p>
