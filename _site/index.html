              <p>Big news, I am an iPad fan. But replacing your Mac laptop with an iPad might seem like a crazy idea. In my opinion, it is not: please give me five minutes of your precious time and explain why‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img alt="Sunny SoCal and iPad Pro are the perfect combo for a productive lockdown" src="/img/ipad.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>I am not <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a>, as I am not saying that my iPad will be my only computer. I might be tempted in the future, but as a research associate, a lot of software that I use daily are Windows or Mac only (not even Linux‚Ä¶). In the meantime, I proudly own an iMac 5K, which is by far my favorite computer (the screen is terrific). The iPad Pro is here for its mobility aspect: that is where an iPad excel compared to a Mac laptop.</p>

<p>I see this post as the first in a long series that will be categorized under <a href="/tag/iPadLaptop">#iPadLaptop</a>. In this first article, I will explain the main reasons that pushed me toward adopting the iPad as a daily portable computer.</p>

<h3 id="the-battery-life-is-so-much-better-than-an-mbp-">The battery life is so much better than an MBP ü§©</h3>

<p>Yes, this is big, but let me tell you one thing: whenever you charge your iPad to 100%, you won‚Äôt have to do it throughout the day. At least, that is definitely true most of the time, but if you are a hardcore FaceBook user, it might be a different story‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Whenever I travel (which is not the case these days ü¶†), I love having my iPad around because I won‚Äôt have to find a plug. From door to door, my iPad Pro as enough battery in most cases.</p>

<p>Even if the battery is a genuinely <em>professional</em> factor, the next one is even bigger.</p>

<h3 id="cellular-internet-connection-wherever-and-whenever-you-want-">Cellular: internet connection wherever and, whenever you want üåê</h3>

<p>If you own a MacBook (Air, Pro‚Ä¶), you know that you will have to rely on Wi-Fi at one point. You might be able to create a hotspot from your phone but, let‚Äôs be honest, that doesn‚Äôt sound professional‚Ä¶</p>

<p>With my iPad Pro, I am connected all the time (if AT&amp;T does its job as intended). That is a big thing! Whenever I travel somewhere, I can only bring my iPad if I want to, and I don‚Äôt have to overthink about Wi-Fi.</p>

<h3 id="most-of-the-apps-i-use-are-really-professional-Ô∏è">Most of the apps I use are <em>really</em> professional ‚å®Ô∏è</h3>

<p>That is one of the biggest complaints that I hear about the iPad as a daily computer. But man, you guys are wrong. Of course, you won‚Äôt necessarily find the same apps that you have on your computer. Still, I assure you: you can discover great yet professional apps on the App Store.</p>

<p>The only one that is truly missing is Xcode‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Most of the series will focus on my workflows, so I won‚Äôt expand on this today.</p>

<h3 id="the-ipad-is-so-much-fun-">The iPad is so much fun üòé</h3>

<p>Did you see that coming? The iPad is so much more fun than a boring laptop. And I tend to be more productive on my iPad too.</p>

<p>If you want me to expand on that point, I will do it in the future, but I am sure that most of you agree on that point.</p>

<p>What I will just say is the following: the iPad is more than just a laptop. It is the greatest tablet of all time. I can read scientific articles on portrait mode and jump back at my desk and use an external keyboard and trackpad to do some writing in less than a minute. Do you often read on your laptop? Because I don‚Äôt. And if I was to do so, it is so much better on an iPad.</p>

<h3 id="the-price-">The price üíµ</h3>

<p>You don‚Äôt have to spend $2,000 to get a great iPad. If you have $1,000, you will get a great machine and a Smart Keyboard folio. You could add a Magic Trackpad if you really want to go all in‚Ä¶</p>

<p>To get a decent Mac laptop, don‚Äôt spend less than $2,000 if you want to keep it for 4-5 years. I have my iPad Pro for 5 years now (I bought the first iPad Pro generation) and spent $1,000 in total. And it is still truly a great daily laptop.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next-">What‚Äôs next? üëÄ</h3>

<p>Okay, now that I said that my iPad is five years old, I have to tell you that I am tempted to replace it with a new generation iPad with a Magic Keyboard. See for yourself:</p>

<p><img alt="Is it truly magic" src="/img/magic.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>But boy, that thing is expensive. And iPadOS really works well on my iPad Pro right now. I will just wait for WWDC this year and see what they will present for iPadOS 14 ü§©</p>

<p>I hope that I convinced you that an iPad is not just about consumption anymore. Of course, watching Netflix is terrific on an iPad. But you can also get so creative with such a powerful tool. I will explain how in my next articles. Stay tuned!</p>

            <article class="post-content">
              <p>The whole process takes roughly a week. You can find many videos online to make your own sourdough starter. Here is what I did to create Marcel and his little brother Gontran, my two starters ü•∞</p>

<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>100g whole wheat flour (unbleached of course),</li>
  <li>150g mineral water (you can use filtered water too),</li>
  <li>Stir well and let grow for 12-24h (while I would strongly recommend refreshing your starter every 12 hours to help it get a nice rhythm, you could let you starter grow for 24 hours with similar results in the end).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>
<ul>
  <li>70g of sourdough starter from previous day (throw away the rest‚Ä¶ You cannot really use it at this time),</li>
  <li>50g whole wheat flour,</li>
  <li>50g unbleached wheat flour,</li>
  <li>115g mineral water (the hydration level is lower today: a lot of water helps wild yeast to grow in the first place but too much water could trigger your starter to rot in the long run! Be nice with your starter ‚úåüèº).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-3">Day 3</h3>
<p>Same as day 2:</p>
<ul>
  <li>70g of sourdough starter from previous day,</li>
  <li>50g whole wheat flour,</li>
  <li>50g unbleached wheat flour,</li>
  <li>115g mineral water.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-4">Day 4</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs lower the hydration level even more:</p>
<ul>
  <li>70g of sourdough starter from previous day,</li>
  <li>50g whole wheat flour,</li>
  <li>50g unbleached wheat flour,</li>
  <li>100g mineral water.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-5">Day 5</h3>
<p>Same as day 4:</p>
<ul>
  <li>70g of sourdough starter from previous day,</li>
  <li>50g whole wheat flour,</li>
  <li>50g unbleached wheat flour,</li>
  <li>100g mineral water.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-6">Day 6</h3>
<p>Same as day 4 and 5:</p>
<ul>
  <li>70g of sourdough starter from previous day,</li>
  <li>50g whole wheat flour,</li>
  <li>50g unbleached wheat flour,</li>
  <li>100g mineral water.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-7">Day 7</h3>
<p>Same as day 4, 5 and 6:</p>
<ul>
  <li>70g of sourdough starter from previous day,</li>
  <li>50g whole wheat flour,</li>
  <li>50g unbleached wheat flour,</li>
  <li>100g mineral water.</li>
</ul>

<p>After such a crazy week, your sourdough starter should rise and fall nicely over 12 hours. One could expect a starter to triple in size during a rise üí™üèº</p>

<p>From now on, you have 3 different options to refresh your starter:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>the best:</strong> every day üëåüèº. In that case, adapt the recipe of day 7 if you want to slightly modify your starter (in my case, Marcel is refreshed using only unbleached wheat flour while Gontran is refreshed using only whole wheat flour). One could also lower the quantities: 35g of starter from previous day, 50g of flour and 50g of water should do the trick.</li>
  <li><strong>the ‚Äúok‚Äù option:</strong> every week üëçüèº. In that case, store your starter in the fridge for a week after a nice rise! Follow the ‚Äúbest‚Äù option steps.</li>
  <li><strong>the ‚Äúmeeeh‚Äù option:</strong> every month üòÖ. I would not recommend that but it could be a backup option ‚úåüèº. After a full rise, transfer your starter in your freezer and let it there for a month. After a month, thaw it at room temp for 24h and refresh it as you would do for the ‚Äúbest‚Äù option.</li>
</ul>

<p>With such a great companion at your side, you will be able to make sourdough recipes in no time!</p>

<p>Stay tuned: next week, I will publish an incredible sourdough bread recipe üòç</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="mb-0 text-justify">Imaging changes in membrane potential using genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicators (GEVIs) has great potential for monitoring neuronal activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. Brightness and photostability of fluorescent proteins and rhodopsins have limited the utility of existing GEVIs. We engineered a novel GEVI, ‚ÄúVoltron‚Äù, that utilizes bright and photostable synthetic dyes instead of protein-based fluorophores, extending the combined duration of imaging and number of neurons imaged simultaneously by more than tenfold relative to existing GEVIs. We used Voltron for in vivo voltage imaging in mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies. In mouse cortex, Voltron allowed single-trial recording of spikes and subthreshold voltage signals from dozens of neurons simultaneously, over 15 min of continuous imaging. In larval zebrafish, Voltron enabled the precise correlation of spike timing with behavior.</p>
