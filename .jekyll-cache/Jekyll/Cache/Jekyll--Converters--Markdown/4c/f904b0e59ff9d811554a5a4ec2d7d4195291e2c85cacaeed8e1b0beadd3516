				<p class="text-intro">Hi there and thanks for reading my personal blog! <br />My name is Guillaume Dubeaux and I am a postdoc fellow at UCSD in sunny SoCal.<br /><br />
Iâ€™m passionate about many different things but, to keep it short, I love <strong>Science</strong>, <strong>Technology</strong> and <strong>Cooking</strong>.</p>
				<hr />
	        </div>
<p>But letâ€™s go straight to the point. I am trying to give some rhythm to my blog. Letâ€™s organize and plan everything. Shall we?</p>

### ğŸ”¬ Monday: Letâ€™s start the week with a Journal Club. #MakeScienceGreatAgain ğŸ”¬
Iâ€™ll be doing a Journal Club by selecting an article that I think relevant for everybody (even non-scientist) to read or at least to be aware of. Iâ€™ll do a short review of and give my opinion on the article as well. These posts will use the following hashtag on <i class="fab fa-lg fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i>: #GDJournalClub&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Iâ€™ve always been in love with science. But to be honest, I only realized during my master that I wanted to be a scientist. To fulfill this goal, I did my PhD at CNRS in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/yahoo.fr/vertlab">Vert lab</a> working on the molecular mechanisms driving the ubiquitination and endocytosis of the plant metal transporter IRT1. I graduated from Paris-Saclay University in December 2016. </p>

<p>In September 2017, I joined the University of California in San Diego to do a post-doc in Julian Schroederâ€™s lab. For this postdoc, I am working on CO2 signaling in plants. #ClimateChange</p>

<h3>ğŸŒ® Tuesday: #TacoTuesday ğŸŒ®</h3>

<p>In SoCal, itâ€™s #TacoTuesday so no blog post, only Tacos with friends! But you can follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gdubeaux/"><i class="fab fa-lg fa-instagram" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> to see my food pics! Just sayinâ€™ ğŸ™‚</p>
<hr />
<h3>ğŸ´ Wednesday: letâ€™s talk About Cooking ğŸ´</h3>

<p>After an epic #TacoTuesday, whatâ€™s best than writing something on food and cooking? This section will be exclusively in French though. I will use the #AboutCooking hashtag to categorize it. You can also follow the exact same posts on Medium. Some guys will help me with AboutCooking but only my articles will be posted on my personal blog. For the entire experience, go check Medium.</p>

<h3>ğŸ§˜â€â™‚ï¸ Thursday: #RelaxationAfterExertion ğŸ§˜â€â™‚ï¸</h3>

<p>Give me a break guys, I cannot write every day!</p>
<hr />
<h3>ğŸ“± Friday: yay! Itâ€™s #TechFriday! ğŸ“±</h3>

<p>You probably saw that comingâ€¦ Friday is gonna be #TechFriday ğŸ™‚ Iâ€™ll give my opinion on something big related to technology. </p>

<p>Technology is probably my main passion. I am always focused on tech. I live for tech, I dream about tech. You got it? I am a tech nerd. </p>

<p>And because of that, I write about tech, I listen to tech podcasts everyday and of course I read tech news as well.</p>

<p>Technology is probably one of the main reason I wanted to live in California. Tech is mostly created there and I wanted to see that with my own eyes... And I am extremely thankful to <a href="https://www.macg.co">MacGeneration</a> that gave me the chance to write about my vision of Tech in California.</p>
<hr />
<h3>ğŸ˜ Saturday and Sunday: #Chill #OrNot ğŸ˜</h3>

<p>We will see. Sometimes, youâ€™ll be able to read my French â€œChroniquesâ€ that I write for the famous tech site <a href="https://www.macg.co">MacGeneration</a>. Some weekends, itâ€™s gonna beâ€¦ Chill time! Maybe a pic or two on Instagram related to sport but I donâ€™t want to raise any false expectations.</p>
<hr />
<h3>You want more than regular posts?</h3>

<p>Oh my god, you want more than that??? Ok, Iâ€™ll try to give it a shot.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I am just going to write some quick thoughts about stuff. So check my blog every day if you donâ€™t want to miss one. Generally, my #QuickThoughts are starting on Twitterâ€¦</p>

<hr />

<p>Thanks a lot for reading my blog. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>And let me know if you have any suggestions (DM on <a href="https://twitter.com/gdubeaux"><i class="fab fa-lg fa-twitter"></i></a>).</p>
