I"ˇ<p>Big news, I am an iPad fan. But replacing your Mac laptop with an iPad might seem like a crazy idea. In my opinion, it is not: please give me five minutes of your precious time and explain why‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img alt="Sunny SoCal and iPad Pro are the perfect combo for a productive lockdown" src="/img/ipad.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>I am not <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a>, as I am not saying that my iPad will be my only computer. I might be tempted in the future, but as a research associate, a lot of software that I use daily are Windows or Mac only (not even Linux‚Ä¶). In the meantime, I proudly own an iMac 5K, which is by far my favorite computer (the screen is terrific). The iPad Pro is here for its mobility aspect: that is where an iPad excel compared to a Mac laptop.</p>

<p>I see this post as the first in a long series that will be categorized under <a href="/tag/iPadLaptop">#iPadLaptop</a>. In this first article, I will explain the main reasons that pushed me toward adopting the iPad as a daily portable computer.</p>

<h3 id="the-battery-life-is-so-much-better-than-an-mbp-">The battery life is so much better than an MBP ü§©</h3>

<p>Yes, this is big, but let me tell you one thing: whenever you charge your iPad to 100%, you won‚Äôt have to do it throughout the day. At least, that is definitely true most of the time, but if you are a hardcore FaceBook user, it might be a different story‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Whenever I travel (which is not the case these days ü¶†), I love having my iPad around because I won‚Äôt have to find a plug. From door to door, my iPad Pro as enough battery in most cases.</p>

<p>Even if the battery is a genuinely <em>professional</em> factor, the next one is even bigger.</p>

<h3 id="cellular-internet-connection-wherever-and-whenever-you-want-">Cellular: internet connection wherever and, whenever you want üåê</h3>

<p>If you own a MacBook (Air, Pro‚Ä¶), you know that you will have to rely on Wi-Fi at one point. You might be able to create a hotspot from your phone but, let‚Äôs be honest, that doesn‚Äôt sound professional‚Ä¶</p>

<p>With my iPad Pro, I am connected all the time (if AT&amp;T does its job as intended). That is a big thing! Whenever I travel somewhere, I can only bring my iPad if I want to, and I don‚Äôt have to overthink about Wi-Fi.</p>

<h3 id="most-of-the-apps-i-use-are-really-professional-Ô∏è">Most of the apps I use are <em>really</em> professional ‚å®Ô∏è</h3>

<p>That is one of the biggest complaints that I hear about the iPad as a daily computer. But man, you guys are wrong. Of course, you won‚Äôt necessarily find the same apps that you have on your computer. Still, I assure you: you can discover great yet professional apps on the App Store.</p>

<p>The only one that is truly missing is Xcode‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Most of the series will focus on my workflows, so I won‚Äôt expand on this today.</p>

<h3 id="the-ipad-is-so-much-fun-">The iPad is so much fun üòé</h3>

<p>Did you see that coming? The iPad is so much more fun than a boring laptop. And I tend to be more productive on my iPad too.</p>

<p>If you want me to expand on that point, I will do it in the future, but I am sure that most of you agree on that point.</p>

<p>What I will just say is the following: the iPad is more than just a laptop. It is the greatest tablet of all time. I can read scientific articles on portrait mode and jump back at my desk and use an external keyboard and trackpad to do some writing in less than a minute. Do you often read on your laptop? Because I don‚Äôt. And if I was to do so, it is so much better on an iPad.</p>

<h3 id="the-price-">The price üíµ</h3>

<p>You don‚Äôt have to spend $2,000 to get a great iPad. If you have $1,000, you will get a great machine and a Smart Keyboard folio. You could add a Magic Trackpad if you really want to go all in‚Ä¶</p>

<p>To get a decent Mac laptop, don‚Äôt spend less than $2,000 if you want to keep it for 4-5 years. I have my iPad Pro for 5 years now (I bought the first iPad Pro generation) and spent $1,000 in total. And it is still truly a great daily laptop.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next-">What‚Äôs next? üëÄ</h3>

<p>Okay, now that I said that my iPad is five years old, I have to tell you that I am tempted to replace it with a new generation iPad with a Magic Keyboard. See for yourself:</p>

<p><img alt="Is it truly magic" src="/img/magic.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>But boy, that thing is expensive. And iPadOS really works well on my iPad Pro right now. I will just wait for WWDC this year and see what they will present for iPadOS 14 ü§©</p>

<p>I hope that I convinced you that an iPad is not just about consumption anymore. Of course, watching Netflix is terrific on an iPad. But you can also get so creative with such a powerful tool. I will explain how in my next articles. Stay tuned!</p>
