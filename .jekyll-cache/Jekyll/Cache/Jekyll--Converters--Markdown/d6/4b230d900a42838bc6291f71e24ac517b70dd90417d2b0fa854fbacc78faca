I"¸<p>I was anxious before this year WWDC. Why?</p>

<p>Simple: Apple was giving the path she would take for the upcoming years if not decades.</p>

<p>And it started simple: Hardware, Software, Services. Combining all three of them gives Apple a major advantage to give one of the greatest ecosystem of all times.</p>

<p>However, in the past few years, hardware has been on a down side with recurring problems for the MacBook Pro, no updates for a major part of the line up and so forth. Recently, Apple tried its best to update a lot of products (even an iPod touch, can you believe it?) and to fix the MBP keyboard with brand new materials. And for pro users, Apple presented a great iMac Pro last year. Is it sufficient though? Apple gave an answer today: no.</p>

<p>After the Keynote this morning, I felt great. Enthusiastic. Powerful. Alive. Because I love innovation. And today, Apple has shown that they listen to people to better innovate.</p>
